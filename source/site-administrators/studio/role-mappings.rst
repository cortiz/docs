Role Mappings
=============

The role mappings configuration file defines the mapping between the group that the user belongs to and the studio authoring role.  To modify the role mappings, click on **Site Config** from the bottom of the *Sidebar*, then click on **Configuration** and select **Role Mappings** from the dropdown list.
