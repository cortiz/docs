Crafter Social is a multi-tenant, platform independent user-generated content management system for handling all actions related to user-generated content (UGC), including the creation, updating and moderation of the content.  It is built on MongoDB and uses :ref:`crafter-profile` for profile, tenant, roles management, and authentication.  Crafter Social is highly scalable in terms of both the users & data, and secures the generated content using Crafter Profile and the Crafter Profile Security library.  As a headless, RESTful application, Crafter Social allows for loosely coupled integration with the vertical applications using it.  Some examples of these vertical applications include:

    - a products site, for example a books site with reviews & ratings,
    - a ratings site and
    - a blogging application with threaded comments.
