..  _content_authors_targeting:


Targeting allows an author to see what the website would look like if it were being browsed by a user with a given set of attributes, called Persona.  It also allows an author to tag the content being authored to the configured personas on the site.

-------------
Tagging Pages
-------------

When creating a page, content can be targeted to the page visitor's segment.  This is done by tagging which segment the page is targeted for.  

To tag a page, in the Site Content panel, click on the **Pages** folder.  Navigate to the level and location within the site navigation tree where you want to tag the content, then right click and select **Edit**.
Depending on how tagging was named/setup, go to the section for tagging content and check the box next to the persona the page is targeted for.  

In the example below, targeting is in the **Metadata** section, under **Segments**, where the available personas are Anonymous, Guy and Gal, and the page is currently tagged for the persona **Guy**.

.. _content_authors_site_views_diff_personas:

----------------------------------------
Viewing the site with different personas    
----------------------------------------

The authoring environment can be configured with any number of predefined persona(s). A persona is like a profile, in fact it behaves exactly the same way but instead of setting up and signing in as specific users to test different scenarios authors can simply switch back and forth between the available configured persona(s).   Each persona has a name, image and a description to help authors identify the scenarios they represent.  

Authors can also change the property values of a given persona once they have assumed it.
