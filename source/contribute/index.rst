Crafter CMS welcomes your contributions! All of our code is open source and is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/craftercms.  
All Crafter CMS projects are written in Java/Groovy and standard front end web frameworks like AngularJS. 

To get started with making your first contribution, choose a project in gitHub and fork it.  Once you finish writing your code simply make a pull request and we'll help you though the process (review, attribution, etc) of getting your code included in to the development code line of the project.  Contributions should be accompanied by any relevant automated tests and documentation.
