============================
Install Crafter CMS from Zip
============================

The zip file will install a fully functional Crafter Studio instance and a Crafter Engine in Preview Mode. Out of the box, the
Studio instance uses a local directory as the repository and a Derby database, which allows a quick and easy set up for local
development.

#.  Download the install zip from http://craftercms.org/downloads.
#.  Unzip the contents in any directory.
#.  Start the Tomcat, by navigating to the INSTALL_PATH/bin directory, and executing startup.sh (in Unix systems) or startup.bat
    (Windows).
#.  In your browser, go to http://localhost:8080/studio.
#.  Login in with admin/admin (any username password will work, the security provider is faux by default).
#.  Click on Create Site, enter the Site Name, the Site Id and pick a blueprint.

After all the previous steps, you should be redirected to your site's dashboard.
